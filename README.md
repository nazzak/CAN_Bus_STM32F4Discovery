# CAN_Bus_STM32F4Discovery

**This project is still very experimental, proceed at your own risk.**

This project shows how to deal with the CAN peripheral on STM32F4

## 1. Build and Test Environment
- Os : Mac os x High Sierra. 
- IDE : System Workbench (SW4STM32) + STM32CubeMX + HAL V1.18.0. 
- 2 x stm32f4discovery boards and 2 x stm32f4discovery shields (MIKROE). 
- 2 x USB cables to power and load a program into the target. 

## 2. File organization
- src : the sources or the stm32f4 project.
- inc : the headers or the project.
- Drivers : HAL driver + CMSIS.
- startup : startup file.
- can.ioc : CubeMX file.

## 3. Setup the environment
- Install SW4STM32 and STM32CubeMX.
- Have a look at the STM32CubeMX Project and peripherals configuration. 
- Import the entire directory to the SW4STM32
- Build and run the program on your targets.
- The software can handle Std and Ext message ID. Edit the define directive on the line 52 in the main.c file  
- Don't forget to swap the messages ID between the 2 boards before programming them. 

## 4. Hardware setup
The shield board embed a CAN Bus transceiver SN65HVD230 from Texas Instruments.  
Below the pin setup :  
SN65HVD230_D_PIN  <==>  PD1/CAN1-TX  
SN65HVD230_R_PIN  <==>  PD0/CAN1-RX

PA0 (blue button) is used in IT mode, to send the message over the CAN Bus. Â 
the state of the LEDs will act according to the message received.  

Connect the 2 bords by their CAN transceiver :  

BORD1_CAN_H  <==>  BORD2_CAN_H  
BORD1_CAN_L  <==>  BORD2_CAN_L
